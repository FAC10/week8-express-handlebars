# Express & Handlebars week

## Notes from previous SGCs

* Continue project from the previous week - we discussed this and decided against it as it would involve sections of the week on teaching auth in express, to be discuss with Alexis, Jessica and Ronan
* Update existing learning outcomes and make them concise and indicate what
  objectives are stretch goals.
* Give guidance on what is expected to be covered by research topics
* No front end testing
* Add a note that it is fine not to complete the project and re-iterate this to the cohort
* Workshop on setting up dev environment with CI, testing and coverage

## Week summary

* At least half of workshops should be code-alongs
* Over course of the week we walk the cohort through incrementally building a favourite articles app, which shows a list of articles and saves them to a database on click and queries the database with favourites.
* Include a front end engineering task in a form of [an animated app drawer](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/drawer).
* The workshop repo will consist of branches with starting points corresponding to the solution of the previous workshop.
* Students can continue working on their workshops either from a) from where they finished the previous workshop or b) from a solution branch.

## Proposed workshops

* Workshop 01 - Intro to Express and middleware
* Workshop 02 - Animated app drawer
* Workshop 03 - Templating with Handlebars
* Workshop 04 - Testing with continuous integration
* Workshop 05 - postgreSQL integration and deployment to Heroku
* Workshop 06 - OAuth integration
